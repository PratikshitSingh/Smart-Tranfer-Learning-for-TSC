3 March work assignment:

Visualization:
1. Plot time-series
2. Plot the 2 time series dataset which you're comparing for distance measure.

pratikshit  - DTW implementation and testing with 5C2 dataset + DBA implementation and testing with 5C2 dataset
siddharth   - PAD impementation and testing with 5C2 dataset
simran      - Pearson correlation coefficient, time lagged cross-correlation and testing with 5C2 dataset


31 March:
model Code - CNN implementation - PS
Data loader Code - Sid
Theory - Analyse and report down the similarity among datasets measured from different distance-measure methods -v Simaran

26 April:
"Analyse and report down the similarity among datasets measured from different distance-measure methods" - based on this work run the same dataset pairs too on the CNN model to get results and verify them
